# RightClick Unbound Product Brief (Phase 0)

## Product promise
Restore right-click and copy on restrictive sites in one click, with an optional Force Mode for stubborn pages.

## Target audience

## Core use cases
- Enable on the current site via the popup.
- Use Force Mode when standard enable fails.
- Manage a per-site list from Settings.
- Remove a site to disable behavior.

## Differentiators
- Minimal UI, fast toggle, clear state.
- Explicit per-site control (no hidden global behavior).
- No account, no data collection.

## Non-goals (v1)
- Bypassing paywalls, DRM, or locked content.
- Automation or scraping features.
- Cross-browser support beyond Chrome.

## Constraints
- Chrome MV3 only.
- Permissions remain minimal and clearly explained.

## Pricing
- Free only.

## Privacy stance
- No data collected.

## Support channel
- Email: support@rightclickunbound.app

## Success metrics (initial)

## Risks and assumptions

## Store positioning
- Short description: "Unlock copy and right-click on sites that block it."
