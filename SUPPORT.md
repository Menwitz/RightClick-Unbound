## FAQ
**It does not work on a site**
- Some sites block scripts with strict security policies or overlays.
- Try Force Mode, then reload the page.
- If there is a blocking overlay, remove it in the page inspector.

**Force Mode breaks a site**
- Disable Force Mode for that site and reload.

**Why do I need to reload?**
- The page needs the updated scripts after you change a toggle.

**Why does it need permissions?**
- The extension injects scripts only on sites you choose, and stores your per-site preferences.

**Do you collect any data?**
- No. Everything stays in your browser.
